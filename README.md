XDG spec dotfiles
=================
These dotfiles are sorted by XDG specification. Keeping that home clean is the way forward.

XDG variables are in config/zsh/zshenv currently.
Root access is necessary to make these global.

TODO
================
* create an initialization script
* add support for other shells
